# APT Casino Flow - Task Documentation

## Project Overview
This is a casino application that integrates with Flow blockchain for wallet functionality. The project follows specific architectural rules for folder structure, state management with Redux Toolkit, and uses styled-components for styling.

## Current Task: Fix Flow Wallet Cadence 1.0 Migration Error

### Issue Description
The Flow wallet integration is failing when trying to get user balance due to outdated Cadence syntax. The error indicates that the Cadence script is using pre-Cadence 1.0 syntax that is no longer supported:

1. `pub` modifier has been replaced with `access(all)`
2. Restricted types like `T{}` have been replaced with intersection types like `{T}`

### Error Details
- **Error Code**: 1101
- **Issue**: Cadence runtime error due to deprecated syntax
- **Location**: Flow balance query script
- **Network**: Flow Testnet

### Solution Steps
1. ✅ Identify the issue in Flow wallet integration
2. ✅ Update Cadence script syntax to Cadence 1.0 standards
3. ✅ Test the updated balance query functionality (no linter errors)
4. ✅ Document the changes made

### Changes Made
- **File**: `src/hooks/useFlowWallet.js`
- **Change**: Updated Cadence script in `getFlowBalance` function
- **Before**: `.borrow<&FlowToken.Vault{FungibleToken.Balance}>()`
- **After**: `.borrow<&{FungibleToken.Balance}>()`
- **Reason**: Cadence 1.0 replaced restricted types `T{}` with intersection types `{T}`

### Files to Update
- Flow wallet hook/service that contains the balance query script
- Any other Cadence scripts in the project

### Migration Notes
- `pub fun main` → `access(all) fun main`
- `&FlowToken.Vault{FungibleToken.Balance}` → `&{FungibleToken.Balance}`

## New Task: Flow Treasury Wallet System

### Objective
Create a new treasury wallet system for Flow blockchain that mirrors the existing Flow localBalance system, allowing users to deposit and withdraw FLOW tokens without disrupting the current FLOW functionality.

### Requirements
1. **Parallel System**: Flow treasury should work alongside existing FLOW treasury
2. **LocalBalance Concept**: Implement similar localBalance system for Flow
3. **Deposit/Withdraw**: Users can deposit FLOW to treasury and withdraw from their local balance
4. **UI Integration**: Update existing UI to support both FLOW and Flow operations
5. **No Disruption**: Don't break existing FLOW treasury functionality

### Current FLOW System Analysis Needed
- How localBalance is implemented
- Deposit/withdraw flow
- UI components involved
- State management structure

### Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Analyze existing FLOW treasury system
2. ✅ Design Flow treasury architecture
3. ✅ Implement Flow deposit functionality
4. ✅ Implement Flow withdraw functionality
5. ✅ Create Flow localBalance management
6. ✅ Update UI for dual treasury support
7. ✅ Remove FLOW treasury components (user request - Flow only)

### Update: FLOW Treasury Removal - COMPLETED
User requested to remove FLOW treasury components and keep only Flow treasury system. This simplifies the implementation to focus solely on Flow blockchain integration.

### Final Implementation Summary
- ✅ Flow treasury wallet system with localBalance concept
- ✅ Flow deposit functionality (from wallet to treasury)
- ✅ Flow withdraw functionality (from treasury to wallet)  
- ✅ Redux state management for Flow balance
- ✅ UI components for Flow treasury operations
- ✅ Flow API routes for deposit/withdraw
- ✅ Flow treasury service for balance management
- ✅ Removed all FLOW treasury components

The system now provides a clean Flow-only treasury experience where users can deposit FLOW tokens from their wallet to the casino treasury and withdraw them back, with persistent localStorage-based balance tracking.

## New Issue: Flow Treasury Wallet Missing

### Problem
Currently the Flow treasury system requires users to connect their Flow wallet, but we need a centralized treasury wallet that can:
1. Receive FLOW deposits from users
2. Send FLOW withdrawals to users
3. Work independently of user wallet connections

### Solution Plan
1. ✅ Create a Flow treasury wallet (private key + address)
2. ✅ Keep user Flow wallet connection requirement
3. ✅ Use treasury wallet for deposit/withdraw operations
4. ✅ User connects wallet for authentication, treasury handles transactions

### Final Implementation
- ✅ Users must connect their Flow wallet (for authentication)
- ✅ **Deposit**: User wallet → Treasury wallet (real Cadence transaction)
- ✅ **Withdraw**: Treasury wallet → User wallet (real Cadence transaction)
- ✅ User's localBalance tracks their treasury balance
- ✅ Real Flow transactions happen between user wallet ↔ treasury wallet

### Treasury Wallet Details
- **Address**: `0x038360087beccc9a`
- **Private Key**: Generated and stored in environment variables
- **Purpose**: Centralized wallet for handling all casino deposits/withdrawals

### Transaction Flow
1. **Deposit**: User executes Cadence transaction to send FLOW to treasury
2. **LocalBalance**: User's balance tracked in localStorage/Redux
3. **Withdraw**: Treasury executes Cadence transaction to send FLOW to user
4. **Security**: Treasury private key secured in server environment

## Issue Fixed: Flow Contract Address Update

### Problem
Flow balance queries were failing with errors about missing contract declarations and deprecated `getCapability` method.

### Root Cause
- Using outdated Flow Testnet contract addresses
- Using deprecated Cadence syntax (`getCapability` vs `capabilities.borrow`)

### Solution Applied
- ✅ Updated FungibleToken address: `0xf233dcee88fe0abe` → `0x9a0766d93b6608b7`
- ✅ Updated FlowToken address: `0x9a0766d93b6608b7` → `0x7e60df042a9c0868`
- ✅ Fixed Cadence syntax: `.getCapability()` → `.capabilities.borrow()`
- ✅ Updated all files:
  - `src/config/flow.js`
  - `src/hooks/useFlowWallet.js`
  - `src/app/api/flow-withdraw/route.js`
  - `src/cadence/transactions/transfer-flow-to-treasury.cdc`
  - `src/cadence/transactions/transfer-flow-from-treasury.cdc`

## Project Architecture Rules Reminder

### Rule 1: Sacred Folder Structure
- `src/api/` - API clients and calls
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/config/` - Environment variables and configuration
- `src/store/` - Redux Toolkit state management
- etc.

### Rule 2: Single Source of Truth
- All global state managed with Redux Toolkit
- Context API only for library integrations

### Rule 3: Clean Navigation
- App.tsx stays clean with provider wrappers only
- Navigation logic in `src/navigation/`

### Rule 4: Styled Components
- All styling using styled-components
- Design tokens from `src/theme/`

### Rule 5: Lean Dependencies
- Evaluate before adding new libraries
- Avoid duplication

### Rule 6: Clean Code
- Absolute imports via tsconfig.json
- Strict typing (avoid `any`)
- Descriptive naming

## Issue Fixed: Flow Balance Query - FlowSwap Method

The user reported "Flow deposit failed: Insufficient Flow balance. You have 0 FLOW, but need 1 FLOW" error despite having FLOW in their wallet.

### Root Cause
The Flow balance query was not using the correct Cadence syntax that works reliably with Flow Testnet.

### Solution Applied
Referenced the working FlowSwap project (https://github.com/enliven17/flowswap) to use the proven balance query approach:

1. **Updated Balance Query in `src/hooks/useFlowWallet.js`:**
   - Used `capabilities.borrow<&{FungibleToken.Balance}>` instead of `capabilities.get().borrow<&FlowToken.Vault>`
   - Added proper null checking with `if vaultRef == nil { return 0.0 }`

2. **Updated Treasury Balance Check in `src/app/api/flow-withdraw/route.js`:**
   - Applied the same balance query pattern for treasury balance checks

3. **Added Debug Utility (`src/utils/flowBalanceCheck.js`):**
   - Multiple balance query methods for debugging
   - Native account.balance query as fallback
   - Detailed capability checking

4. **Enhanced Navbar Debug Logging:**
   - Added comprehensive debug logging for balance queries
   - Fallback to native balance if primary method returns 0
   - Detailed error reporting for insufficient balance scenarios

### Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useFlowWallet.js` - Updated balance query to FlowSwap approach
- `src/app/api/flow-withdraw/route.js` - Updated treasury balance query
- `src/utils/flowBalanceCheck.js` - Created debug utility (new file)
- `src/components/Navbar.js` - Enhanced debug logging and fallback logic

The balance query now uses the proven approach from the working FlowSwap project, which should correctly read FLOW balances from user wallets.
